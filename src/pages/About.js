      <p className="dark:text-white text-lg font-gabriela text-left mt-3">
        Highly skilled and motivated Frontend Developer with over 2 years of
        experience in designing and implementing exceptional user interfaces.
        Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and NEXT.js, I have a strong
        understanding of modern web development practices and a passion for
        creating intuitive and visually appealing websites.
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-white text-lg font-gabriela text-left my-5">
        Throughout my career, I have successfully collaborated with
        cross-functional teams, including designers and backend developers, to
        deliver outstanding digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="dark:text-white text-lg font-gabriela text-left my-3.5">
        I excel at translating design mockups and wireframes into responsive
        and pixel-perfect web pages, ensuring seamless functionality across
        different browsers and devices, and I am excited about opportunities
        where I can use my knowledge of multiple stacks to bridge the gap
        between design and the end-users.
